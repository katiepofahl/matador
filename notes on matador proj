#notes to myself

Cleaning original matador data sheet to create grassbank partner line plot over time
- make a copy of original 
- create one row for column names, delete unnecessary objects, remove totals, create consistent column names (in excel)
- save each sheet as .csv (eg: data10.csv)
- read in data to R using read.csv
- in each object create a year variable data10$year <- 2010
- rbind.fill in plry to row bind data sheets (this will create columns for all unique column names)
- rename column names using colnames(dataframe) <- c("a", "b" etc - put in all of the column names I want)
- SUCCESS!
- to create plot in base r: 
plot(conserved_area ~ year, data = mydata, type = "n")
lines(conserved_area ~ year, data = mydata[mydata$landowner == "A",])
**copy paste the line above for each landowner

for (i in 1:length(list.files())){

# $dollar sign indicates variables
#data frame is built of variables (eg: mydog <- xyz)
#for variables you can call up data from inside data frame with [row,column/variable]
# pull up help file for a command/function by putting ? in front (eg: ?which) 

#rserch functions: head, tail, summarise, filter (eg: just matador rows), select (look for blogs)
