#notes to myself
# $dollar sign indicates variables
#data frame is built of variables (eg: mydog <- xyz)
#for variables you can call up data from inside data frame with [row,column/variable]
# pull up help file for a command/function by putting ? in front (eg: ?which) 

#rserch functions: head, tail, summarise, filter (eg: just matador rows), select (look for blogs)

  #summarise all prairie dog data for example using summarise()
  
  
#format/reshape
  #create variables sage_grouse and year
sage_grouse <- 
  
  
  newobject <- mydata %>%
  filter(Type="matador")
  
  #eg: ggplot2(newobject, aes(x=  , y=  , color=  , row=  )
  gb_conserved_protected
  
  #write data out
