Katie Pofahl

This is the V1 script for my project to make summative descriptions and a plot for data from Matador Ranch, MT,
a grassland conservation program which begain 14 years ago. This program consists of Matador Ranch, a large ranch that 
is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy Montana. They work with I did not receive all of the data I would need to do what I had
hoped to do, so I am currently exploring the data to understand if there are intresting trends that I might want to dive
in to more.

Definitions:
Conserved lands are lands that the organization has protected in some way through this program.
Protected lands are lands that have some form of permanent protection. This is a new initiative for the program.
