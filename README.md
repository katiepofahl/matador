Data Science Class Project, Fall 2019
Katie Pofahl

This is the V1 script for my project to make summative descriptions and a plot for data from Matador Ranch, MT,
a grassland conservation program which begain 14 years ago. This program consists of Matador Ranch, a large ranch that 
is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy Montana, and member ranches from the surrounding area, referred to as "grassbanks". These ranches graze their cattle for parts of the year on Matador Ranch in exchange for conservation measures on their home ranch. 

I did not receive all of the data I would need to do what I had hoped to do, so I am currently exploring the data to understand if there are intresting trends that I might want to dive in to more.

Definitions:
Conserved lands are lands that the organization has protected in some way through this program.
Protected lands are lands that have some form of permanent protection. This is a new initiative for the program.
